# FOR REFERENCE ONLY

This directory and its sub-directories contain pre-Claude-Code implementations of the project. They are messy, but they work and should be preserved for legacy purposes.

You can reference them, but do NOT alter them, and be cautious about copying code from them into the newer implementations without first verifying that complex code is necessary for desired functionality. Simplification of the previous implementation is a goal.
